<p>For example, the creatures above ar of the class Wizard. They can be described by certain attributes, such as name, creature type, and attire:</p>

<code>
class Wizard:
    name = "Defaultanor" # set attribute, ‘name’ for the class ‘Wizard’
    creature = “Human Wizard”
    attire = [“Cape”, “Robes”, “Staff”]
     
    def change_name(self, new_name): # note that the first argument is self
        self.name = new_name # access the class attribute with the self keyword   

player1 = Wizard() # instantiate the class
print(player1.name) # print the current object name 
player1.change_name("Novador") # change the name using the change_name method
print(player1.name)
</code>
